        <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">This system was developed for the purpose of connecting students with their professors and curriculums in an easy and intuitive way.
            It consists of the following three components: Administrator, Professor and Student.
            <br>
            The Administrator component enables the management of all users, school subjects, students' grades, mailing system, and general timetable. It also monitors the user's activity, database backup, error logs and much more.
            <br>
            The Professor component enables employees to track their subjects and enrolled students. It allows the user to manage relevant data, which directly influences students' progress, and can be extracted in the form of a report card.
            <br>
            The Student component allows the user to monitor his own progress, have access to relevant news, create his or her own reminders and connect with school staff. It was developed having in mind students and their preferences regarding both functionality and design. 
            <br>
            Administrator and Professor components are represented through a web application, while the Student component is represented through both IOS and Android mobile applications.
